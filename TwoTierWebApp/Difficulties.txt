likhithero -> basic s3,ec2,elb,asg full access permisssions

VPC
-VPC CIDR Block -> 256ips i.e /24 = 1 range  (10.0.0.0/24)
-subnets 
 -privateSubnet1ForEpicReads (private) ->10.0.0.0/26
  -it has range of 10.0.0.0 -> 10.0.0.63
 -privateSubnetForEpicReads1 (private)   -> 10.0.0.0/26
  -it has range of 10.0.0.64/26 -> 10.0.0.127/26
 -privateSubnetForEpicReads2 (private)
  -it has range of 10.0.0.128/26 -> 10.0.0.255/26 -> 10.0.0.128/26
 -a rout table is associated, which has route to internet gateway on 0.0.0.0/0. so this subnet is officially public.
 -a route table is not attached so the other subnet becomes private
-security

DB
-login to and perform DB operations 
 -mysql -h epicreadsdb.c7wqsskqayed.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p  -> you can find rds-endpoint in the RDS instance.




publicSubnet2 -> 10.0.1.0/26









Difficulties

- DB was not created until the VPC has multiAZ subnets it asks for multiAZ
- RDS DB has its own subnet groups because RDS doesn't sit on one subnet so create a group with private Subnets.
- cannot find installation page 
  - root cause php cannot intaract with the database(sudo dnf/yum install php-mysqlnd) and we didn't define the plugin definr('wp_config_database',true)
-after the setup of load balancer I didn't get my website
 -solved by editing the user-data in the launch templte (didn't install httpd).

notes:
1.instances in the ASG don't have publicIpv4
